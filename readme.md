#### Analysis for Array Block

The `array_block_pthread.c` program splits an array into sections, each processed by different threads to compute sums concurrently.\

In testing, the `MOESIF protocol` demonstrated completed the task in 4516 cycles, compared to 5493 cycles under MESI and 6340 cycles for both MSI and MOSI. \

This superior performance of MOESIF can be attributed to its utilization of Owned (O) and Forward (F) states, which are particularly effective in a multi-threaded environment like this program. These states facilitate direct cache-to-cache data transfers, reducing the need for more costly memory reads.\

To be more specific, MOESIF's reduction of memory reads to 36, compared to 48 in MESI, and it's \$-to-$ Transfers are higher than the other protocols, optimizing the parallel computation of the sum and significantly speeding up the process.

#### Analysis for Array Stripe
In the array_stripe benchmark, where threads access the array in an interleaved pattern, the MOESIF protocol vastly outperforms others, completing the task in just 6680 cycles compared to over 26000 cycles by MESI and even more by MSI and MOSI.

This efficiency stems from MOESIFâ€™s advanced cache state management, particularly its Owned (O) and Forward (F) states, which facilitate direct cache-to-cache data transfers and significantly reduce the need for slower main memory accesses. The protocol's ability to efficiently handle frequent cache misses and synchronize data among multiple cores with high cache-to-cache transfers (251 transfers) and minimal memory reads (36 reads) makes it exceptionally suited for applications with complex memory access patterns like the array_stripe setup.
### Analysis for Array Sum Benchmark

In the `array_block` benchmark, performance benefits stem from the contiguous memory access pattern of each thread. Each thread processes a sequential segment of the array, which improves cache locality and minimizes cache misses. Since each segment is handled independently by a different thread, there's less need for inter-thread communication and cache synchronization, resulting in more efficient use of the cache and faster computation times.

Conversely, the `array_stripe` benchmark involves threads accessing the array in an interleaved pattern, where each thread picks elements spread out across the entire array at regular intervals. This pattern significantly increases cache misses due to the non-contiguous nature of data access. Additionally, it requires more frequent synchronization among caches to maintain coherence, as threads are more likely to need access to overlapping parts of the array stored in different caches. This leads to increased cache coherence traffic and reduced overall performance compared to the  `array_block` setup.

#### Analysis for MatMul Rows

In the MatMul Rows benchmark, the `MOESIF` protocol significantly outperformed others, completing the matrix multiplication task in just 54322 cycles, compared to higher cycles required by MSI, MESI, and MOSI protocols.

 This efficiency in MOESIF can be attributed to its advanced cache states like Owned (O) and Forward (F), which facilitate effective data sharing and minimize memory traffic. With the lowest number of memory reads (101 reads) and the highest cache-to-cache transfers (759 transfers), MOESIF enhances data availability and consistency across threads, reducing the need for frequent main memory accesses. This optimized cache coherence mechanism is crucial for operations like matrix multiplication, where rapid, synchronized access to shared data is essential for performance.

#### Analysis for MatMul Cols
In the MatMul Cols benchmark, the `MOESIF protocol` outperforms MSI, MESI, and MOSI, completing the matrix multiplication in only 121722 cycles.

 This efficiency is largely due to MOESIF's advanced cache state management, specifically its Owned (O) and Forward (F) states, which optimize data sharing and reduce memory traffic. MOESIF reduces memory reads to just 101, compared to higher numbers in other protocols.
 
  This is particularly advantageous in scenarios like column-based matrix multiplication, where frequent, synchronized access to shared data across different processors is critical for performance.
### Analysis for Matrix Multiply Benchmark

In the "matmul rows" benchmark, each thread is assigned a specific set of contiguous rows from matrix a and is responsible for calculating the corresponding rows of the resultant matrix c. This arrangement tends to localize memory access within a specific range, promoting better cache utilization and minimizing cache misses. 

The localized access pattern means that once a row of matrix a is loaded into the cache, it can be used effectively to compute multiple elements of matrix c across all columns, reducing the need to frequently access the main memory. However, this can also mean increased cache-to-cache transfers when different threads need to access overlapping columns of matrix b, which is a shared resource among the threads.

Conversely, in the "matmul cols" benchmark, threads are assigned specific sets of columns from matrix b to work on, affecting all rows of the output matrix c. This distribution leads to a less localized but more distributed memory access pattern, as each thread has to access entire rows of matrix a to compute partial results for columns of matrix c. This widespread access increases cache misses since data from matrix a cannot stay in the cache long enough before being evicted due to the needs from other threads working on different columns.**The interleaving of memory accesses across all rows and the continuous requirement for different parts of matrix a result in higher memory traffic and potential contention points in the memory system.**

#### Analysis for Pipeline

In the Pipeline benchmark, the MOESIF protocol demonstrated superior performance, completing the task in 80351 cycles, markedly less than the 108778 cycles taken by the MSI protocol, the 107552 cycles by the MESI protocol, and the 84559 cycles by the MOSI protocol.

This significant reduction in cycle count under MOESIF can be attributed to its efficient cache state management, which minimized memory reads to just 54 and facilitated 1343 cache-to-cache transfers. The effective reduction in memory operations and enhancement of cache-to-cache communications underscores MOESIF's suitability for scenarios demanding rapid and efficient data processing across multiple computational stages.

#### Analysis for Map-Reduce
 The MOESIF protocol performs exceptionally well, completing the task in 53,324 cycles, significantly faster than MSI at 73,327 cycles, MESI at 72,421 cycles, and MOSI at 61,319 cycles. 
 
 This enhanced performance in MOESIF is attributed to its efficient handling of cache states which minimizes memory reads to just 52, compared to higher numbers in other protocols. MOESIF's ability to effectively manage cache-to-cache transfers, totaling 986, optimizes data sharing between cores, essential for the Map-Reduce operations where data must be frequently shuffled between the map and reduce phases. These characteristics make MOESIF particularly suited for the concurrent and distributed nature of Map-Reduce tasks, ensuring faster data processing and reduced latency across multiple cores.
